# Introduction To PyxemIUMAS

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a presentation of pyxem at the Open-Source Data Analyis Workshop as part of IUMAS-8 in
Banff Canada.  There are some extras (including notebooks for creating some of the figures etc. 
that might be of interest if you are curious about how things are created)

Pyxem is a project for analysis of pixelated diffraction data, primarily 4-D and 5-D STEM datasets using out of memory, parallel,
and accelerated workflows to provide end to end analysis. For complete documentation see [here](https://pyxem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Pyxem is open-source and developed entirely on github.  See [here](https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem) if you are interested in seeing 
how any of the package is implemented or curious about further development.  We are always looking for new developers, collaborators,
and users so feel free to drop by, open an issue or give a star.
